# Clean Code Challenge #1: Refactoring
You are working on a service for renting bobby cars. Unfortunately a user has reported a bug. To reproduce the bug, simply run the Tests in the DemonstrateApiUsage-Class (make sure the Dependency-Service is running). Fixing the Bug shouldn't be too hard. 

Once the Bug is fixed, you - as a responsible developer - write a small Unit-Test to make sure the fix works as expected and to avoid regression. 

Note: The Demonstrate-Package is not meant as a test, but only for demonstrating the Bug. YOu are supposed to write a Unit-Test that does not require a running Dependency-Servie.
